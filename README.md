# About Me

I'm Stefan, a Computer Science student at the University of Bonn focusing on Computer Vision and physics informed machine learning. I am interested in scene representation and realistic scene generation with interactive environments. Thus, most of my time is spent on learning and reading. Some of the topics I am currently anhancing my knowledge in are Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision and Audio/NLP. I firmly believe that a combination of these will enable novel technologies and interactions with other humans, computers or even robots. If you are eager to learn more or get in touch, feel free to contact me :).

# Tech Stack

Frequently I use the following techstack:

- Python (PyTorch, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
