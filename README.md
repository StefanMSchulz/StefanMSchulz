## About Me

I'm Stefan, a Computer Science PhD candidate at the University of Bonn focusing on Computer Graphics and Computer Vision. More precisely, my work evolves around Capture Stages, Differentiable Scene Representation, Reconstruction, and Synthesis. Throughout my previous studies I was able to broaden my knowledge by working on robotics projects, medical informatics and physics informed machine learning. As of now, my main interests are Computer Graphics and Computer Vision with the ultimate goal of providing something useful to humanity.

If you are interested in learning more about me or collaborate on a project, feel free to hit me up!
