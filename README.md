### Hi there 👋 I'm Stefan 
🚀 PhD Candidate | Computer Vision & Graphics Researcher | AR/VR Enthusiast  

---

I'm a PhD candidate in the **Digital Material Appearance Group** at the University of Bonn, working with **Prof. Matthias Hullin**. My research focuses on:

> 🎯 **Differentiable Scene Representation for 4D/6D Capture, Reconstruction, and Synthesis**

This work lives at the intersection of:
- 🧠 Computer Vision  
- 🖼️ Computer Graphics  
- 🕴️ Motion Capture  
- 🌐 AR/VR  

I’m passionate about building systems that **understand, capture, and synthesize the real world** — bridging the gap between **state-of-the-art research** and **real-world applications**.

---

### 🔍 Current Focus
- Neural rendering & volumetric representations  
- Differentiable rendering & optimization  
- Real-time 4D scene capture  
- Applications in immersive environments (AR/VR)

---

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
`Python` • `C++` • `PyTorch` • `OpenCV` • `Blender` • `CUDA` • `Git`

### 📸 Outside the Lab
When I’m not writing code or papers, I’m probably:
- 📚 Reading sci-fi (big fan of the "Perry Rhodan" series)
- 🥾 Hiking (remote) trails
- 📷 Practicing photography

### ✨ Fun Fact:
I’m currently working on real-time view synthesis without per-scene re-training and I am always open to cool research collabs or projects pushing the limits of what's possible.
